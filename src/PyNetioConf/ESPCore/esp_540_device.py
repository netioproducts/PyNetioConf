        Creates the device object for a NETIO device running firmware 5.4.x and newer. This is normally not called
        directly: NetioManager.init_device detects the firmware version, opens and authenticates the WebSocket
        connection, and passes that connection state in through kwargs.

        The 5.x.x versions of Netio firmware have been severely redesigned, which includes the entirety of the API
        used to communicate with the device. Therefore this init is completely separate from the base classes and
        does not call super().__init__. If the base NETIODevice class gets updated, this has to be updated
        accordingly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        host : str
            IP address or hostname of the device, without any URL parts such as 'http://'.
        username : str
            Username to log in with. Note that many actions require administrator privileges.
        password : str
            Password for the user.
        sn_number : str
            Serial number of the device. NetioManager passes an empty string; the 5.x classes don't use it.
        hostname : str
            Network hostname of the device. NetioManager passes an empty string; the 5.x classes don't use it.
        keep_alive : bool
            If True, a background thread pings the device every 120 seconds to keep the WebSocket session open.
        netio_manager : NetioManager | None
            The NetioManager instance the device belongs to. Used after a firmware update to replace the object
            with the class that matches the new firmware version.
        use_https : bool
            Communicate over HTTPS and secure WebSockets (wss://) instead of HTTP and ws://. HTTPS must be enabled
            on the device. Also silences urllib3's InsecureRequestWarning, since devices use self-signed
            certificates.
        **kwargs : Any
            Connection state handed over by NetioManager. None of these are required when creating the object by
            hand, but without them the init opens and authenticates a new connection itself.

            ws_connection : websocket.WebSocket | None
                An open WebSocket connection to the device. If None, a new connection is opened on login.
                Default None.
            is_ws_auth : bool
                Whether ws_connection is already authenticated. If True the login step is skipped, otherwise the
                init logs in with username and password. Default False.
            ws_req_id : int
                The next request ID to use, so that IDs continue from the requests already sent on
                ws_connection. Default 0.
            ws_helo_data : dict[str, Any]
                The device's full reply to the initial HELO request, which carries the public key used for password
                hashing. If not given, a new HELO request is sent. Default None.
            device_version : tuple[int, int, int]
                Firmware version of the device as (major, minor, patch). Also selects the API dialect: on 5.4.x and
                newer, requests use GET instead of SUBSCRIBE. Default (5, 4, 0).
            ssl_options : dict[str, Any]
                SSL options passed to websocket-client as sslopt whenever the connection is (re)opened over wss://.
                NetioManager builds this from the ssl_* keyword arguments of init_device. Default {}.
